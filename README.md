## Quest Form 

This form was added to make it more simplistic to add your quest entries with the right calculations.

- First and foremost each Zone that a Powerstone is in is Indexed from 0 to 9 and listed as 1-10.
- This form is index based! So Powerstone 1 is PowerStone Index 0.
- This is the **PowerStone** Button located on the MainForm.
- Generate Button shows your the Entry before Applying it.
- The Apply button will not show unless Generate button is clicked.
- Apply Button will replace globalGamplaySetup Property with the updated Calculations.
